description: Open the Claude Boops sound editor to customize notification sounds
---

Open the sound editor to customize your notification sounds.

To do this, run the settings script from the plugin directory:

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/settings.sh
```

This will:
1. Start the sound server on port 8765
2. Open the visual editor in your browser
3. Allow you to customize frequency, duration, and volume for each sound

When you're done editing, click "Generate Sound Files" in the editor to save your changes.

Press Ctrl+C in the terminal to stop the server when you're finished.
