Opening the Claude Boops sound editor...

This will:
1. Start the sound server on port 8765
2. Open the visual editor in your browser
3. Allow you to customize frequency, duration, and volume for each sound

When you're done editing, the changes will be saved to config.json automatically.
Press Ctrl+C in the terminal to stop the server when you're finished.

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/settings.sh
```
